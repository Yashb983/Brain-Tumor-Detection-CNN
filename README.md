# Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning (CNN)

This project detects brain tumors from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Description
The model is trained on MRI images of tumor and non-tumor cases. It learns image patterns and predicts tumor presence in new scans.

## Result
Model achieved around 88% accuracy during training.

## Future Scope
- Medical image segmentation (U-Net)
- Web app deployment
- Real-time detection

Developed a deep learning project for detecting brain tumors from MRI images using CNN. Used Python, TensorFlow and OpenCV for image preprocessing, model training and prediction. The model learns image patterns and classifies tumor vs non-tumor cases with high accuracy.
